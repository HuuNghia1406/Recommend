- Data Warehouse: Design a relational schema for the data warehouse (library_warehouse) with 2 fact tables and 15 dimension tables.
- Data Visualization Dashboard: Use Power BI to connect and import data from the data warehouse.
- Association Rule Mining: Use the Apriori algorithms to mine association rules from historical borrowing data.
- Recommendation System: Use TF-IDF,Word2Vec to create a feature matrix for books and Train a recommendation model using the KNN algorithms. Build a simple web interface using Streamlit to allow users to enter keywords and receive book recommendations.
